-- =====================================================
-- BACKFILL TRUST SCORE HISTORY FOR EXISTING USERS
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Create initial history entries for existing TrustScores
--          that don't have any history records yet.
--
-- This is a one-time script to populate history for users
-- who had trust scores before the history tracking feature.
--
-- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)
